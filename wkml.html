        <h1><span class="caps">WKML</span>: a Fortran library for producing <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/" title="external link to http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/" class="http"><span class="caps">KML</span></a> output.</h1>
<p><span class="caps">WKML</span> is an output module built on top of <a href="http://uszla.me.uk/space/software/FoX/" title="external link to http://uszla.me.uk/space/software/FoX/" class="http">FoX</a>, expressly designed to aid the outputting of <span class="caps">KML</span> from Fortran – in order to allow th easy visualization of geospatial data as produced by Fortran programs.</p>

<p>Go straight to<a href="http://source.uszla.me.uk/FoX/wkml" title="external link to http://source.uszla.me.uk/FoX/wkml" class="http"> download</a>. (Note that this version is a pre-release version, with several known bugs)</p>
<p>Many commonly used scientific programs in the geospatial domain are written in Fortran; and many geoscientists are most comfortable programming in Fortran. Visualizing data in Google Earth requires the use of <span class="caps">KML</span>, which is unfamiliar to many traditional geoscientists, and for which there are no existing Fortran interfaces.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WKML</span> brings the power of Google Earth to within the grasp of the Fortran-literate scientist, and enables existing Fortran codes to output data to Google earth with only trivial amounts of effort.</p>
<p>We have already successfully used <span class="caps">WKML</span> to generate visualizations in multiple scientific domains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Glaciology, using <a href="http://glimmer.forge.nesc.ac.uk/" title="external link to http://glimmer.forge.nesc.ac.uk/" class="http"><span class="caps">GLIMMER</span></a> – inspecting the three-dimensional form of a predicted ice-sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/glimmer-kml.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/glim.kml" title="external link to http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/glim.kml" class="http">glim.kml</a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">KML</span> depicts the calculated form of an ice sheet over Greenland. The height is magnified by fifty times to make it more visible; and in addition colour is used to highlight the variation in height.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seismology – using <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~felixw/hypoDD.html" title="external link to http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~felixw/hypoDD.html" class="http">hypoDD</a> – refining estimates of earthquake epicentres.</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/hypoDD-kml.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/hypoDD.kml" title="external link to http://www.uszla.me.uk/images/wkml/hypoDD.kml" class="http">glim.kml</a></p>
<p>This illustrates two datasets; initial and final estimates of the epicentres of a group of seismic events; the blue-black placemarks are initial, and red represent final estimates. The size of the placemarks represent the magnitude of the earthquake.</p>
